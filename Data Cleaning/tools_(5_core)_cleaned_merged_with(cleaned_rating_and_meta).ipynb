Even so, it was a two person job -- wife had to hold the drill at a distance to keep the line from kinking and it too me two hands to feed the coil down the drain.  A great deal of turning torque was required to get into the clog.  Probably hand turning would have worked if I had a second person turning.  But wife wasn't home when I decided to try the drill.  The crank to turn the coil is inferior to the old fashioned double bend metal crank tube with a locking screw.  the latter is both easier to turn and can be moved along the coil so that it is closer to the drain.  That keeps the coil from kinking, which mind did.  Will still work.\\n\\nthe business end is very clever -- simply an stretched out section of the coil.  It threaded itself into the hair clog.  The clog that came out was about the size of a very large mouse.  (Not as disgusting, however, it was mostly thread from towels.)       1\n",

It would be used so rarely that I simply don't see it as worthwhile to include.\\nSecond, an more importantly, why do the manufacturers insist on making LED headlamps with three AAA batteries? Why not with a single AA battery? Much simpler. Batteries are sold in EVEN numbers, not threes! Buy four and you have one left over that ends up getting lost by the time you buy your next batch. Ultimately, to come out even you have to buy a dozen batteries. Very annoying.\\nI happen to live in West Africa. AAA batteries are expensive and hard to find here. AA batteries are ubiquitous.\\nPlease, manufacturers, make AA-powered headlamps!\\nThis is my only reason for giving this headlamp four stars instead of five.\\n(A year or so later) I still like the two headlamps but have a MAJOR criticism: the tab that keeps the case together broke off on both the headlamps! I have to keep them together with tape. They still work just fine.

My wife and son frequently forget their keys, and I am definitely not OK just leaving a key under the mat or above the door, so this has turned out to be a convenient solution. At this point I get notifications on my phone whenever it is locked or unlocked. If one of us uses our code, then it will tell me the name of the person that locked or unlocked it. We can lock or unlock it from our phones and also create/edit user codes from our phones.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t hook it up to a \"smart\" hub, like Smartthings, Wink, etc., you can still use the lock by doing all the programming from the keypad, you just won\\'t get notifications on or have control from your phone or other devices.\\n\\nI don\\'t have experience with any of the other smart locks, but at this point I would recommend the Schlage Connect.',\n",

Great start.\\n\\nHmm, CON: It only has cigarette charging cord.\\nOof, even worse: it needs a full SIX HOUR charge before first use . Hope you have a long drive planned for that camping trip... Luckily, we have an auxiliary battery in our van so we plugged it in and left it without worrying it would drain the whole battery. Still, it's good to know before hand.\\n\\nPRO: Set up was easy and straightforward.\\n\\nCON: There was some leaking when I first hooked the pump up to the water carrier. But that was fixed when I re-threaded it.\\n\\nIgniting the pilot for the first time was also a little tricky as the gas lines have to fill.\\n\\nAlso, getting the knob into just the right spot to depress it to start the ignitor didn't happen on the first try... or two.\\n\\nPRO: Once ignited, I turned the knob to MAX. It took under 20seconds to get hot water.\\n\\nThe pressure from the sprayer head was good enough to wash dishes.

I guess if you have lots of knobs to change, this is a good price tier at ~$15/door, but if you only have a couple doors to change out, consider spending in the $30-$40 range for other brands that are preferrably solid brass, like Baldwin. Build quality is significantly higher.',\n",
       " \"I got this installed with little issues, just like most of the other people.  I was replacing a deadbolt so it was a straight drop into place.  My only complaint on the install is that after you connect the inner part to the electronic connector coming from the keypad outside, there's plenty of wiggle room with the cable length UNTIL you have to tuck it in the track - then I could barely get the whole assembly to slide over the shaft it needs to go onto without the cable pulling out of the recessed track you have to use to make the large interior box sit flush on the door.\\n\\nThe programming frustrated me at first but then I realized I had missed the fact that I had to press the digit for the length of the codes I wanted to use TWICE.  Once I learned that and could set the code length, the programming was flawless.  Also note that ALL codes must be the same length, and if you change the length, it wipes all the existing codes.\\n\\nThe unit itself is nice, physically, although I'm predisposed to be less than happy with anything that requires a monthly fee for some part of it to work.  For the list price, you'd think you should at least be able to access it locally without their service.  I have another Schlage electronic Nexia unit, the knob with the built in keypad, that I use for my door from the garage into the laundry room, and I found that you can get a micasaverde unit so that you can use Z-wave products without any monthly fee, so I may look into that for both of them.\\n\\nThe next disappointment was that it only comes with one key.  I've never had any kind of door securing product, locking knob or deadbolt, that didn't come with at least TWO, figuring in many households there may be more than one person who would need it in case of electronic / mechanical failure of the unit.  Yes, it's easy to get a duplicate made, but for this list price, not adding a second key just seems like a cheap decision.\\n\\nI like the looks, the black doesn't bother me since I have a very high tech house and my furniture and electronics are black anyway, so this actually matches my interior better than any other option I've seen.  I like having the visual cue with the deadbolt knob to easily glance and see that it's actually deadbolted (which isn't necessary with the auto lock feature anyway, but still nice if you have a little twinge of OCD and like to double check things yourself still).\\n\\nThe keypad is nice, I'm also one who didn't necessarily like the stick out rubberized number pads either.  But while it doesn't get fingerprints, it still collects oil from the skin, so it's not a perfect surface always.\\n\\nAnother thing I didn't like, if you have a nexia account, there's an online cancellation procedure you have to go through, answering all the questions and such, but then they *STILL* require you to CALL them to cancel it otherwise they'll keep billing you.  I find that completely unacceptable - why bother making you go through the whole online procedure if it doesn't count and you have to call anyway?  Save yourself the trouble, just call them and don't bother with the online part of the process.\\n\\nNow, this was where I was very disappointed.  Unit seemed fine, but when you first power it up, it's supposed to go through some deadbolt operations, and you're supposed to wait until it finishes before you continue.  Mine never was able to do those initial operations.  I was able to program just fine, got the length of the code set to what I desired, added a code, and tried it.  I heard the motor working but the bolt never moved.  The motor spins in there, but on mine apparently there's something either broken or not manufactured right, because it's not actually MOVING anything.  I even pulled the inner section back off, kept it connected, and tried, and nothing.  So it's not an issue with tension.  There's three screws holding the entire mechanical/electrical assembly to that inner rectangular part, so I took it out, and you can see all the gears inside, and not a single gear is moving when the motor actuates.\\n\\nSo while I'm sure that if this works, it's a decent unit and probably worth three or maybe four stars if you stretch it (at least when it's being sold for half the insane list price), I can't give it more than a one, because I've yet to see that it could actually function.  I did contact support but since it was a free Vine program evaluation item, I'm expecting that they won't jump through hoops to make it work.  If they do somehow get it to work or replace it, I'll update this accordingly.\\n\\nEdit 4/17/13 - Called the support number, since the email support simply told me to do a reset on the device - hardly makes a difference to reset the electronics when the physical gears are the problem.  Did it anyway, no luck, so got phone support on the line, got a support person who really wan't much more than a cheerleader for the product and kept telling me how great these were and how much people liked them.  Did me no good as I had one that was completely useless as anything other than a standard knob and key deadbolt.  She did not comprehend the problem of the gears not turning.  She also kept talking about resetting and programming - none of which makes a difference when you can see the motor inside spinning just like it should, just when it should, except that it's not even physically touching the gear it is supposed to be meshed with.  All the electronic resets in the world won't make ANY difference when the gears are not properly installed.  I'm going to guess there's manufacturing issues and that the quality is not consistent...  Sounds like a great unit when it works, but it's a total waste when you get one in my condition.\",\n",

It is also important that you maintain a wet edge.  If the paint dries even a little bit and you try to brush over it  you will get an uneven finish.

       " 'This was a replacement of the same model that was purchased in 2012.  A couple of things of note that I think people should know...\\n. CO alarms need to be replaced every so often.  I learned this after hearing about a family that perished because of CO even though they had a detector.  Quote from Google search on how often to replace, \"The detecting components will lose their effectiveness after 5 to 7 years and may no longer detect carbon monoxide. First Alerts website states: After 5 years any detector should be replaced with a new CO alarm. COSTAR recommends replacing their CO alarms every 6 years or sooner.\"\\n. My First Alert started beeping suddenly one day, 3 beeps then a minute or two or maybe three, then 3 beeps, over and over again.  Battery wasn\\'t the problem.  Came to learn it was the \"malfunction\" code.  I\\'d had the unit for 5 years already, so gladly replaced it.  I am grateful the unit notified us!\\n. Sometimes our detectors have beeps randomly (they are hardwired in our home) and we don\\'t know what\\'s going on - we know it\\'s not a fire or CO because it stops and pauses and starts again.  What I\\'ve learned is that it\\'s the detector\\'s way of communicating something to us.  What I\\'ve also learned is that I can never find the darn manual when this happens.  So, I have advice...\\n  - Best is to keep the manual in a place you\\'ll remember and can get to quickly.  If you are like me, once those beeps start, you\\'ll be instantly on edge and won\\'t be in any state to search all over for a manual from years ago.\\n  - Second best advice when the unit is giving a message, remove it from the base and look on the back.  It actually has beep decipher information written on the back.\\nI do like these First Alert detectors.  They are a good quality.  However, I do with there was a way to turn the beeps off when it\\'s just a false alarm (kids burning too much incense, for example).',\n",

Initially daylight savings time resetting must have messed it up so that the timer portion of it just wouldn't work. Then I tried setting it to an hour earlier than I wanted it to turn on/off and it worked perfectly. I guess the outlet itself has its own time and hasn't been adjusted to take into account DST even though there is a DST checkbox on the app. I have not figured out what the scene function is for and I don't need it so I'm not taking that into consideration for this review (I tried testing it but nothing happened and I didn't try very hard). The only reason I gave it a 4-star instead of 5 is my husband said that when you are trying to control the remote via 3G, it initially sends the wifi password through an unsecured line (or something to that effect).

In typical installations, you should be able to use just this hose to connect refrigerator to water outlet.

With the refrigerators automatic fill set at 22 fl. Oz., it took just under 22 seconds to fill the cup before and after addition of this hose, so no measurable flow restriction.  The original hose (in our installation) is visible along the wall from the refrigerator to the cabinet with the water outlet.  The original hose shook visibly when the refrigerators water valve shut before addition of this new hose.  It still moves a little (thus the 4-star review), but not as much and not as harshly as it did without this hose.  I guess no water hammer arrestor is perfect, but this one does a nice job of mitigating the shock.\\nThe instructions on the package recommend replacing the hose after 5 years, regardless of condition, as seems typical of lots of connector hoses (with or without water hammer arrestors in them).

Why?\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t come with instructions. The only documentation I received was a high level diagram of the pieces (I\\'ve added a photo).\\n\\nSo here are some instructions to help get you started:\\n1. Remove the center bar of the ball (the top and bottom so the ball is completely empty). You will want the space to get your hand in and out. If you don\\'t have slender hands you might have a hard time getting your hand into the ball (I\\'m a 5\\' 11\" guy with slender medium sized hands and was okay).\\n2. Start with the bottom lights and work your way upwards.\\n3. Hand tighten the nuts. Usually that\\'s sufficient, but I found a few times where I needed pliers to help tighten (a little tricky given the spherical shape)\\n4. Once all the lights are in, as another review suggested, tie 5 or 6 wires together with a lead (I bought a 20 light fixture so tied 5 lights to a lead wire creating 4 lead wires for Load and 4 more for Neutral). Then tie the leads together with the top fixture. There\\'s quite a bit of room in the ball, so you don\\'t need to be careful with space - to stay organized though :).\\n\\nThe missing stuff:\\nHere are items I think should be included with the light, but were not:\\n- 8 lead wires to bundle groups of lights together.\\n- 10 wire ties.\\n\\nThe unusual stuff:\\nQuality of the components seed quite good - but I did get a few unusual extra pieces (nuts & washers) in my kit. See photo. Had there been good quality assurance I don\\'t think this should have slipped through.\\n\\nIt took me just over an hour to put the light together, and overall it was pretty simple. I thought that would be the hardest part but I was mistaken. It was only when I went to hang it that I realized that the holes didn\\'t line up with the holes in my light socket. The documentation sheet shows that the light being installed with anchors into a beam instead of connecting directly to a socket. Perhaps my socket is old (it\\'s from the 70s) and sizing has changed since, in which case I likely could have found an adapter, or if the holes on this light are just unusual. In any case I managed to create my own adapter and hang it up.\\n\\nFor lights I bought 24 of these:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Spherical-Design-Dimmable-6W-E26-Base-High-Efficiency-Warm-White-2700K-Practicality-LED-Bulbs-60W-Light-Bulbs-Equivalent-6-Pack/dp/B0739LS77Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Spherical Design Dimmable 6W E26 Base High Efficiency Warm White 2700K Practicality LED Bulbs 60W Light Bulbs Equivalent 6 Pack</a>&nbsp;- I figure it\\'s good to have a few extra for future replacements.

The back portion is lined with marks so you can tell what way is forward and reverse when putting back together. Use a sewing needle to unclog the holes. I held the piece up to a window to see all the clogs.\\n\\nIt's kind of inconvenient but it will save the boys! My guess is the minerals obviously break down over time causing it to clog. We don't have hard water here so it's the minerals in the head itself. If you have hard water just use these steps too.\\n\\nI almost want to give this three stars due to the pain it has been causing, but in reality it is a four star product. If you could replace the minerals and not have to toss it after a year that would be beneficial too. I might order another one at this 11 dollar price point though honestly.\",\n",

Need I say more? OK, I will. My hair and skin are awesome. My peers use conditioner on their hair... me? rarely. And, I usually have long hair.

       " \"I wanted to find the best mask for the terrible air pollution in Beijing China. After several days of research, I narrowed the choices down to 3 brands: 3M 95N, Totobobo (Singapore) and Respro Techno (UK).\\n\\npm2.5 refers to particulates smaller than 2.5um (A hair's diameter is 30 times of pm2.5). They are extremely harmful to lung and heart as they can penetrate deep into the lung and blood. 3M 95N stands out in terms of its technical superiority. It can remove 95% of super fine particulates (down to 0.3um). In comparison, totobobo does not filter out as many particulates according to a fit test done by Hongkong University, and Respro can only filter out particulates down to 1um (according to the very little technical spec.on its website).\\n\\nAny of 3M 95N has the same technical ability to filter out fine particulates. So the key is to find one that fits the best and wears the most comfortable. A basic one would be 8210V (V stands for breathing valve which lets the moisture out). 8511 is a step up that has better elastic band and a bit more rigid form. It is more durable than 8210V.\\n\\nI find the best to be 9211+. It is fold-able and individually packaged (great for travel or storing away). The nose band (made of foam) runs across the whole length. When formed around the nose properly, it provides a very good fit to the face. The mask fits both my husband (Caucasian) and I (Asian) very well.\\n\\nUnderstandably, the air flow is reduced while one wears the mask, but I don't find the mask overly suffocating or hot to wear. I am willing to sacrifice some comfort to protect my lung. Since I own the mask, I finds it also to be quite useful when doing some house cores.\\n\\nIn short, I highly recommend it particularly if you are traveling to countries with bad air or working in a very dusty setting!\\n\\nUpdate: I recently spent 2 weeks in BJ and wore 9211 daily. It had a snug fit to my face and felt comfortable to wear. In comparison, 8210V is less fitting and also its rubber band less comfortable. In spring, air quality is better than the heating season. Still I found that the mask became blocked after one week and I had to replace with a fresh one.\",\n",

I got tired of the lights breaking while in my light stand...falling over or loading them in car or storing them on their side and something bumping them...so I grabbed these LED's to try to add some durability.  They are plenty bright and are close to 5500 in color, but jjust a lil cooler.

       " \"I was rather skeptical of this product, costing $171 with tax. After all, one can buy a perfectly adequate shower head for about $25. Could it really reinvent the process of taking a shower? Would I need to pull out the water restrictor? Could I cleanly install it without problems?\\nOn first try there was some leakage of water both at the connecting wand and near the attachment point to the wall, even using teflon tape (not included). I retried, using both more twisting force and about 6 roll-arounds of the tape. Problem solved. Installation was easy. The head of the unit can tilt around by about 15 degrees like any other shower head but it require some force. Don't be shy about grabbing and rotating to the proper angle.\\nThe shower experience is absolutely magnificent! When you observe the video of the product on youtube you get a feeling of the young model being inundated by water. That's exactly how it feels. A cone of water comfortably soaks you, like being drenched in a rainstorm. Totally removes all soap in a few seconds so efficiently there is little need for the wand. I hate the feeling of sharp needles. This is the opposite of that. Best with both the wand and outer head going at the same time. The hand held wand removes and clicks back firmly and securely into place with the help of a little magnet. Nice. Also like how easy it is to pause the water flow on both head and wand units when soaping up.\\nThe pressure I obtained with the water restrictor in place was exactly like the video. More than sufficient. We are on ground level and have excellent water pressure. Without the restrictor water would pool up over the drain. If however you need to remove the restrictor just look into the piece that screws on to the wall and you will see rubber washer with a metal screen filter. Carefully remove it by prying it out but be careful not to damage it. Immediately behind the washer/filter is a lavender colored flow restrictor. Since it is only held in by friction you can push it out from behind. Removing the flow restrictor will void your lifetime warrenty so keep this part in case you need to return your unit. The procedure is easily reversible.\\nIs it worth the money? Based on the materials, no. Based on the technology and the overall experience I would say absolutely yes. I have the shiny chrome model and it looks really impressive in our glass shower stall, another plus. We live in South Florida so taking a second mandatory afternoon shower used to be drag. Now, I look forward to diving under this delightful contraption for a soothing  refreshment. Enjoy!\",\n",

You have to push down on the barrel with one hand while while simultaneously pulling up. So, we need a second person to hold the hose because the water pressure is enough to make it want to whip around. Second, the outlet hose is a 1\" coiled wire hose.

The leakage was so bad and fast that, although I haven't tried it yet, I doubt these would even keep out regular rain and sprinkler watering. I went ahead and sealed mine  with silicone caulk to be safe.  Wish they'd supply a 12v - 18v version, would be much safer\\n\\nOther than that, this is an amazing light for the money- bright enough for accent lighting, lots of colors, a nice slow color cycle, various dimmer modes,  as well as flash modes -very annoying in all lights as far as I'm concerned, but it's there. Compact, the remote works well though needs to be pointed at light to work so if could be tough to use it to adjust lights pointing away from you, but it does keep the last setting unlike some reviews I've seen. So overall I love it and would buy it again. Mine also came with a three prong plug on about a 3ft cord. Metal case, looks pretty well made other than the leakage issue.\",\n",

Of course, one needs descent basic tools to perform the task properly.\\nI do a lot of car and motorcycle harness repair jobs which requires patience, knowledge and good unique tools to complete the job.

(meaning, wipe the tip off on a damp sponge and apply just enough new solder to flow over the complete soldering area of the tip and let cool) This seals the tip for the next job.\\n2. be sure you have tinned (whetted with flowed solder) both sides of what's being soldered prior to soldering them together. This will eliminate any issues you may run into when one of the two items has problem with solder flow.\\n3. flow the solder to on piece, apply the tinned second piece and the insure wetting has flown over both parts evenly and with a shiny.

I also carried around a four-LED headlamp for years to use at night that was essentially as bright as the four LEDs on this SOG.  So, I thought that this might be a convenient replacement for both and allow me to just carry this around with me instead.  In the end, probably not - let me explain why.\\n\\nThe video (available once Amazon approves it) shows off the knife and lights, but I made it mostly to point out what wasn't obvious (at least to me) in the pictures until I used it.  Namely, the thumb studs light up like it's Christmas when you turn the lights on with the knife open - at least on the satin polished version that I have.  SOG did a very good job in that the light output is essentially shadowless because the lights are symmetric around the blade, but the aspect of getting very bright glint off of the thumbs studs is a big design oversight, IMO.  I don't know if it would have actually been better, but I think that a thumb hole like on my Benchmade would have been a better choice.\\n\\nAlso, I learned when the box arrived that it is rated to run for about four hours on a set of batteries.  Back in the days when Niki would walk a lot, I'd use my LED light for an hour plus a night, so this really isn't a good choice as a flashlight substitute if you plan to use the lights often for much time.  You need to remove ten hex bolts from the plates over the batteries to replace them.  Probably a five or ten minute job, so not that bad, but definitely less convenient than popping a new set into a regular flashlight.  Luckily, you can get rechargeable batteries for this, though.  On a side note, it would have been immensely cool if they would have had a built in charger in this that let charge them in place...but I digress.\\n\\nI did kind of expect this knife to be more gimmick than useful, but I have to say that it is built better than I expected.  At nearly $40, though, it should be.  The handle is lightweight but solid, and the blade is good.  Another reviewer had blade wobble right out of the box, but I don't have any of that.  In fact, my blade is a little stiffer to move than my other folding knives and locks into place solidly.  The blade arrived nice and sharp, and workmanship seems good.\\n\\nOverall, this knife certainly might be useful for some of you, but it isn't the perfect marriage of two tools for me.  The knife is pretty solid, and the LEDs are pretty bright, but the stray light from the thumb studs and the sides of the LEDs - along with the short-ish battery life given the work to swap them out - are big limitations in my book.  It's around a solid 3.5 stars for me, between me really liking it and just thinking it's okay.  I rounded up to four stars because it has enough going for it that I think three stars is too low.\\n\\nPros:\\n(*) Overall feel is pretty good.  There is some rattle from the aluminum battery covers when tapped, but it feels solid\\n(*) Blade arrives sharp and seems well made\\n(*) Lights are decently bright and plenty for seeing a few feet in front of you.  They aren't going to let you see down the block or very far in the woods\\n\\nCons:\\n(*) Lights shine brightly off of the thumb studs on the blade, at least on the satin polished version\\n(*) Lights are pretty bright even from the side, so tilting the handle a bit towards you will shine them into your eyes.  Perhaps a future version will have a side shade on the lights\\n\\nConsiderations:\\n(*) No serrated section on the blade\\n(*) Batteries are rated for four hours of use and require you to take out ten hex bolts to replace them\\n\\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to leave a comment and I'll respond as quickly as I can.

That said, it\\'s a beautiful piece that will complement a lot of different decorating styles.\\n\\nPros:\\n+ Easy installation: If you\\'re going from an old single hole faucet to this the installation will probably be pretty easy. Keep in mind that this Moen has a weight that attaches to the sprayer hose below the counter. This helps the hose to retract itself but you\\'ll need to route the sprayer carefully.\\n\\n+ Self retracting spray hose: As mentioned above, there is a weight on the hose which allows the hose to retract itself. I didn\\'t realize just how very useful this feature is until I had it for a week. Now I dread the thought of going back to our old style hose that I had to fish back into its lair.\\n\\n+ Push button sprayer (see cons below): It\\'s super easy to push the little button on the back of the faucet head and get a spray pattern that is high pressure and diffused. This makes it perfect for spraying soap off of dishes and food debris from the bottom of the sink.\\n\\n+ Nice finish: The \"no water spots\" finish works surprisingly well. It DOES still show spots after awhile but it\\'s not nearly as pronounced as our old shiny stainless steel faucet.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Pressure to keep spray: I praised the sprayer earlier in this review but there is one thing that keeps it from being perfect. It takes a decent amount of pressure to keep the spray function active. Sometimes, I actually do just want a constant light spray. Because this faucet returns itself to a normal water stream when the water is off, I think they tuned it just a little too high. In other words, if I want to have a constant low pressure spray, I need to keep my finger on the spray button. It\\'s minor, but I wish I could use less pressure.\\n\\nNo hot/cold indicator: This is another minor thing but I do still miss it. There is no indicator to show when the sprayer is in its \"neutral\" position. With our old traditional faucet, I just knew that the center of the sink put out lukewarm water. With the new Moen, it\\'s a little less clear. As above, it\\'s workable, but I would like just a tiny center line indicator.\\n\\nFinal Verdict: I really like this thing. As I mentioned, there are a few small flaws -- I wish I could give it a 4.5 star review instead of a full five. Regardless, they are SMALL flaws. It\\'s a beautiful and functional piece that\\'s built like a tank and should provide many years of service.',\n",

       " \"I ordered this light to illuminate a flag in front of my home as well as my house numbers on my porch post. I did a lot of research into these solar lights and found this one stands out among the rest.\\n\\nTo keep this an easy read, I will list why I feel this stands out and is better than the others.\\n\\n-The rechargeable battery these use is a 2200mah lithium battery. Note - Cadmium batteries of around 500-1000mah are typically used. Cadmium batteries do not hold a charge as long as lithium batteries do. It should also be noted that the lower mah power tend to putter out quicker than the 2200mah by far.\\n-It is very bright for a solar light. This has 4 leds and puts out 200 lumens. Most solar lights (which I am sure you have seen for yourself) are very dim, have fewer leds and sometimes you can barely see them.\\n-It has the ability to change the angle and the solar panel and the led head so you have the panel tilted for best sun contact and the light where you need it.\\n-It is well built. That plastic was not thin nor did it feel like it would break with use.\\n-It has two mounting options. Most of these lights only come with the stake method. This one has holes around the base and it comes with screws  sinks so you can mount on a flat surface.\\n-Has three settings. Off, Low and High. So you can adjust for a soft or more hard light pending the application. (Note  Low and High both use an auto off feature so it comes on when it is dark and off when it is light.)\\n-Leds are rated to last 50,000 hours.\\n\\nTip  Just keep the solar panel clean. When the panel is dirty, it will not charge as quick or as well leaving your battery not fully charged. This would go for any solar panel product.\\n\\nSummary  I was rather impressed with this light and enjoyed the above things which set it apart. I would certain recommend this to friends and family.\\n\\nI don't know about you, but I depend very heavily on reviews that are posted on Amazon. I also read what reviewers on Amazon have to say. I want to help others by providing my reviews that detail the product as well as the experience I have with the products that I get on Amazon.\\n\\nPlease note I have no relationship with this seller and Im not compensated in any way for my review.

       " \"Well, in case you are considering purchasing these, here are my thoughts after a week and 1500 miles worth of pulling with these installed.\\n\\nFirst-The accuracy of the system: I have 2 digital pressure gauges. They are a brand and model that Consumer Reports gives high marks to for accuracy, so I am assuming they are accurate. They both read within 1 lb. of each other on any given tire at any pressure.\\nCompared to the 2 pressure gauges, which agree with each other, the TST-507 monitors are all reading 5 lbs. low. That is a 4.55% error. All 8 of them I own. The manufacturer claims a 0.73% accuracy rate.\\nNo biggie I figure, as all I care about is the alarm when one starts to deflate for whatever reason.\\n\\nI have no idea whatsoever why these things have an over pressure alarm. If you set a tire pressure to the manufacturers recommendation, then over pressure is an impossibility.\\n\\nOn the topic of the high-pressure alarm, the recommended 15% over isn't enough. On my G-614's running at 110 psi and the air temp. at 55-65 degrees, I was getting alarms. Given the sensors actually report 105 lbs. at a real pressure of 110 lbs, I added 15% to the 105 reported lbs. of pressure. That equaled about 121 lbs. The G-614s were reporting 125-126 lbs. on my trip (sunny 60 ish degrees) Adding the 4.55% error meant that the tires were actually at just under 132 lbs of pressure while rolling. I had to go to like 128 psi for a high-pressure alarm to stop it from alarming.\\nAgain, I can't even figure out why they do a high pressure alarm. I set my tires correctly at a cold pressure, and they are going to get to whatever pressure they do for the temps. I am driving in.\\n\\nTemperatures come in with about a 4 degree maximum spread when read off of my trailer sitting outside in the dark.\\n\\nThe D.C. plug: The metal part that inserts into the side of the monitor is about twice as long as it should be. Once inserted fully, there is a substantial amount of the metal plug that is still protruding from the side of the monitor housing. This makes it VERY prone to bending. I wish it plugged in flush.\\n\\nReception: I have a 2013 Ram 3500 super-cab and a Montana 3400 RL. When mounted on the windshield of the truck with the supplied window mount, the unit would no-way pick up all for signals from the trailer and keep them. Sometimes different tires on the trailer would report, other times, other tires. Never all four at once. No problem getting the 4 truck tires.\\nI had to move the monitor to the rear window of my truck to get and keep all the trailer tires locked in. Impossible to read back there, but I didn't care. I just need to here an alarm if one starts going flat. Not worth buying the $59 repeater antennae.\\n\\nI'm glad now I didn't get the flow-through sensors. These remove and reinstall very, very quickly, and they are lighter.\\n\\nThe alarm: Loud. Unmistakably loud. You won't miss it if it sounds.\\n\\nSo, in the end, it works and works well, but It has a learning curve. You need to figure out it's percentage of error in PSI and set your high-pressure alarms accordingly or you will be scared accordingly when the alarm goes off for no reason. And for mine at least it had to go way above the recommended 15% over.\\n\\nI'm glad I got it. It's good piece of mind, considering the vast majority of blow-outs happen because of underinflation.\",\n",

Since then it's followed me through every DIY job I've chosen to punish myself with -- the regrouting of a master bathroom, numerous weekend woodworking garage projects, window-sill soot removal, furnace/AC ductwork cleanings (those elbows beneath the floor registers where all the little kiddie toys, dust balls and cupcake sprinkles collect). I've relied upon it for car carpet cleaning, doggie barf pickup, scraped-paint chip collection, and for thoroughly removing sawdust from the collection bags on my orbital sander and chop saw. Through all of it, this vacuum has sucked hard. And, on top of that, this vacuum really blows too. The easy removal of the blower portion converts the unit into a hand-held, electric leaf blower that's every bit as powerful (if not more so) than those gas-powered monsters used by professional landscapers to clear leaves and annoy the neighbors for blocks at 6 in the morning on summer Saturdays. For the record, this blower is not only quieter than the gas-powered ones, it also never works before 11 am on Saturdays because, well, neither do I.

As the description says, pictures do not do it justice.  The wings light up with alternating vivid colors.  The rounded base (globe) pulses with light that generally changes from blue to purple to red.  The butterfly detaches rather easily from the globe.  It can be swiveled  around where it is attached at the very top center of the globe.  This will allow you to adjust the position of the butterfly to optimize your viewing angle.  I can swivel mine a good 180 degrees without the wings rubbing up against the wall.  I have placed it out in the open in my living room where I do my main TV viewing.  I leave it on while I am in there even with the TV on.  It is not distracting to  have it on with the TV.  I just love looking over at it from time to time.  I will mention that it is a pulsing light.  So someone may find it disturbing in a bedroom setting if you plan to leave it on at bedtime.  The butterfly body has nice detail to it and is colorful in the daytime.  The daylight image here on Amazon is accurate.  The night images don't capture how cool looking the light is.  I would say the dimensions given here are accurate too so it sticks out from the wall a bit compared to many night lights.  This was a pleasant surprise for me when I got this.  For goodness sakes, if you get one, put it somewhere you can view it easily and not in some little corner behind furniture.  You won't be disappointed.\\n\\n12/12/11 quick update.

I bought this one first and returned it and got the Bosch.\\n\\nThe concept for the DeWalt is actually pretty good but fails in it\\'s present implementation.  The rigid poles are a great idea and they are quite sturdy and well made.  If you bought two kits, in theory you could use this with very high ceilings.  The pole is the same size from locking mechanism which is about 8\" from the foot all the way to the top which is very nice.  There big problem with the DeWalt is the locking mechanism.  You turn the poles  about a quarter turn to lock it but it doesn\\'t work 90% of the time.  You think its locked only to find out its not.  The locking issue is compounded with fact that the locking mechanism is on the bottom pole.  There is a foot lever to compress the spring, and you turn the poles to lock it in place.  To lock the poles, you compress the spring with one foot while trying to balance and keep most of your other weight on the other while at the same time bending all the way down at your waist and grabbing the poles in both hands  and trying to twist.  It doesn\\'t sound easy and its not!! I was going to keep it but after about the fourth use, the locking mechanism would not unlock.  I had to use a couple of pipe wrenches to unlock it and it didn\\'t tighten very much after that so I sent it back.  I bought the Bosch which is much easier to use because the locking mechanism is up near your chest and the spring is on the top of the pole.  The spring at the top has a about 6\" of travel so you can lock the poles and then press the top foot against the ceiling, push up and compress the spring and then move the bottom into position.  (This isn\\'t possible on the DeWalt because of the funky locking mechanism).  The down side on the Bosch is that it made up of three telescoping poles, The bottom pole is the thickest, and top pole is the smallest which makes moving the pole attachment device tricky if you need to move the laser level to different heights when installing tiles.  I like the Bosch because it works and it\\'s cheaper.',\n",

       " \"Update 11/30/2015 - The phantom flushing went away after the company sent a replacement lid.  However, apparently the motor has gone out or perhaps the gears.  It started flushing only halfway, then quit altogether.  Removing the unit, I found that initially the motor was rotating correctly but only when it was not pulling the chain.  Replaced the batteries just to be sure and the same thing happened then it couldn't even lift the plunger at all.  Overall I would say that this is a great product (big caveat) when working.  The quality and durability would have to be significantly improved for me to even consider buying another which is why I downgraded to two stars.  Looking at other reviews, nearly everyone else has had similar problems.  I went back to my standard manual flusher.\\n\\nOverall, I like this product.  It was easy to install for someone who is reasonably handy and works just as described.  After about 3 months it started 'phantom flushing' (in the middle of the night of course) which was very irritating.  I ended up removing the battery pack until I did some research and discovered that this is a known defect caused by moisture buildup inside the unit.  Apparently the first version of this was not properly sealed.  I called Kohler and they sent me a replacement lid free of charge that came in about 5 days.  In the meantime, I found that if you leave the unit open for a few hours, it will dry it out and then was working fine until my replacement arrived.  The replacement has only been in place for a week or so so I will see how it is working a few months from now and provide an update.\\n\\nFor me, one significant Con is the price.  It's really just a small motor and battery pack with a sensor.  Nice to have in one toilet but clearly not necessary and I can't see spending the money to install one throughout the house.  Still, like I said it does work as advertised and when there was an issue Kohler provided a solution free of charge which says a lot about the company.\",\n",

I am pretty clumsy when it comes to using knives in the kitchen as I have cut myself badly enough to have stitches twice, so using these types of gloves is a good way to help protect me from myself and from most of my clumsiest situations.  The gloves are made similar to others with a tightly woven cloth material.  This particular pair has a few sloppy areas where there is some loose threading, mainly in the seam areas around the fingers but not to the point of the seams being compromised.  My old pair of cutting gloves have some similar issues that occurred after a few uses.  The gloves are lightweight and made for being able to handle things in the kitchen and still be comfortable by not getting your hands hot and sweaty, almost like what a tactical glove would be, although not as durably made as tactical gloves.  With that being said, these gloves are not meant for heavy duty use (like in construction) and are a kitchen and around the house type of glove.\\n\\nWith what seems to be a common issue with this type of gloves is that these are a bit small on my hands.  Although the gloves fit on my hands, the finger web areas feel a bit tight.  I would say my hands are an average size for my height (I am 58), so if you have really large hands, then these most likely won't fit.  I would classify these as a medium to small size gloves and should fit those with average to smaller hands well, but I do wish a larger sized set were available.\\n\\nI tried slicing across the gloves like I did with my old set with a sharp steel knife, a ceramic knife and a steel serrated blade knife.  Granted these won't protect from any stabbing type motion but the gloves held up fine to knives being slices across them, including a serrated blade.  I wouldnt say these are cut proof  (more cut resistant) as the serrated blade made a slight mark on the gloves but the gloves will at least provide some protection for the hands in most accidental kitchen cutting situations.  I would much prefer these damage the gloves slightly than my fingers and they do that just fine.\\n\\nThe only issues I have with the gloves are the sloppy stitching in some areas and the tight fit, especially in the finger webbing area.\\n\\n4 stars\\n\\nI was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated.\",\n",

       " \"Update: 21 DEC 2016\\nThe ICM286 I installed in May failed last week due to water corrosion on relay K5 (gas valve relay). I spoke with ICM and they don't warranty water damage. However, we shared some notes and they now realize ICM286 is a replacement for White Rodgers 50A55-743. I mentioned how Goodman (or the installer for the furnace) placed the furnace board INSIDE the return plenum, mounted on the blower motor housing. That plenum had lots of signs of water condensation dripping on the housing, trickling down on the board from time to time. So I can't really ding the ICM286 for this issue, but I wish they used marine-grade components. The ICM286 does swap the position of the HEAT and COOL taps from the original factory board, and the 12-pin harness orientation is different. The Neutrals are spaced better as well. Overall, the ICM286 seems like a better design - it would benefit from additional conformal coating around the pins of the relay as extra insurance. I did relocate my new replacement White Rodgers board outside the plenum. I wanted to buy another ICM286, but they are out of stock for weeks at Amazon. They are available from online distributors though.\\n\\nOriginal Review:\\nThe ICM286 is a direct-fit replacement for Goodman boards PCBBF123 and PCBBF112 (or the S versions) as well as the Emerson White Rodgers 50A55-743. My Goodman furnace, GDS80403AN (Revision BB or GDS80403ANBB), suddenly stopped working one night. The fan wouldn't even turn on when controlled by the thermostat. There was no heat either. I had to troubleshoot it myself and found that the transformer and t-stat worked fine. The board LED didn't turn on, and I diagnosed it as the control board. Doing a quick search online, I found that White Rodgers / Emerson made a 50A55-743 board which turns out to be the original OEM board on the Goodman, and are made in China. Doing some digging, I found out PCBBF112S supersedes PCBBF123, and another search found that ICM makes the ICM286 which is a direct form/fit/function replacement for the PCBBF112S but at half the price, and the ICM286 is made in America. I even watched the video on ICM's website showing Americans manufacturing the ICM furnace boards in the US with American tooling.\\n\\nOnce I received the ICM286, I noticed several design changes from the original PCBBF123/50A55-743 board. The ICM286 has the EAC (Electronic Air Cleaner) and HUM (Humidifier) connections, as well as the TWIN connection. My original Goodman didn't come with these features and the board just didn't have any hookups on the board. The ICM286 also uses a much brighter modern LED. The harness connection is rotated 90 degrees. There's a jumper that is moved across to select the heater fan delay between 90-200 seconds. The White Rodgers and Goodman boards defaulted to 150 seconds, but I switched my ICM286 to 120 seconds. The ICM286 used a lot more conformal coating to protect the integrated circuits.\\n\\nOverall: 5/5 stars, Made in the USA at half the cost of the Made in China OEM boards, great build quality, 100% form/fit/function replacement\",\n",

The tools arrive in a clam case and they are slightly oily when removed (not a complaint - merely an observation).  Each tool has the FORD emblem on it in at least one location (three of the tools have the FORD name in 3 locations) - kind of overkill in my opinion.

Furthermore, when I visited the only website listed on the package (ford-tools.com) on 6/30/15, there is also no additional information regarding the warranty - only product information.

I took the Badger right back for a refund. After hunting around a bit I came across the Evolution which, although still made by Insinkerator, is clearly made to a higher standard. Even though it costs a lot more than the Badger I could see the metal body wasn\\'t going to fail in the same way the Badger\\'s plastic will.\\n\\nThe Badger and the Evolution both use the same sink assembly which is a total pain to install. The trick is to put a heavy weight on top of the assembly as you struggle to get the snap ring into place. I put a 10lb tin of peaches in the sink over the assembly and then put the Evolution on top of that. With my wife\\'s help we got the snap ring on in about two minutes compared to the ten minutes it took without the peaches.\\n\\nThe lock ring that connects the body to the sink assembly was only held in place by a plastic collar on the Badger which simply wasn\\'t good enough. The lock ring on the Evolution is held in place with a metal collar. It actually does the job. Yay - that was much easier. Even though it\\'s a lot heavier, getting a good seal to the sink assembly was easier than with any other garbage disposer I\\'ve installed.\\n\\nNow the Evolution is wider than the old garbage disposer so I had to cut 1/2\" off the horizontal pvc pipe that ties it into the plumbing. You have to cut the down pipe to length anyway so the extra cut is no big deal. Attaching the dishwasher is easy if you remember to remove the plug before you install it :-) I\\'ll try to remember that next time.\\n\\nBe aware you will need to buy a strain relief for the electrical wires. I don\\'t know why they don\\'t include one - they know you will need it. At this price that\\'s inexcusable. However the electrical work is very easy. I had to use an external connector box but most people should be able to complete the connections inside the disposer\\'s body.\\n\\nSo now I flip the switch. I works beautifully. It\\'s quiet and efficient.\\n\\nOne reviewer was disappointed theirs only lasted five years. I\\'d be thrilled to find a garbage disposer that lasted that long. Not a negative in my opinion.

I have never done a great deal of welding, but from time to time I need to assemble or fix something, so I go to the arc welder. I have a couple of older helmets. As anyone knows who has welded without an auto-darkening shield,  it is always difficult to place the rod where it needs to be on the metal being welded since it cannot be seen with the old helmets in place.\\nThe Jackson takes care of this problem. Since I had never used one of these helmets before, I adjusted the settings for auto-darkening sensitivity and level of light protection. There is a scale to be found in the direction booklet. I fit the helmet adjustments for my comfort and read about cleaning and protection of the helmet while not in use. I then went to a bright incandescent light bulb with the helmet on and flashed on the light bulb several times. The shield darkened immediately. I experimented with changing the light sensitivity of the helmet to see how this would affect the darkening and ability to see the bulb. In this way I learned how the helmet functioned without committing myself to the arc light. I became satisfied that the helmet did just what it should do and did it well. Then I went to the welder and experimented with using the helmet the way it was designed. I did some welding.\\nIt was a pleasure to see the metal pieces to be welded before arcing began. The change from normal sight to arc light protection and back happened fast without any unwanted flash of light ( I was skeptical ). My old helmets will likely end up in the garbage. The Jackson is comfortable, easy to adjust and affords good protection.\\nI like everything about the helmet, and its 5 year warranty.',\n",

       " \"These ear muffs are perfect for around-the-home or on-the-job use.  The NRR protection rating of 34dB is quite good and they really worked to muffle sound around me.  Now, ordinary conversation is around 60dB, so these aren't noise canceling by any means.  I used them around the house, checking them out to see what would be muffled or totally canceled out.\\n\\nI couldn't hear my typing, a tap on a can, but I could hear thing like a knock on my desk.  The knock was muffled, but I could barely hear it.  Of course the true test of these safety ear muffs would be to haul them outside and mow my lawn.  Its that time of year and what better time to add some hearing protection to the mix?  One household member wears double hearing aids and I certainly know the value of good hearing.  I also know how devastating it can be to lose it.\\n\\nMy lawn mower is an old gas-powered clunker and much louder than my electric.  This thing is probably the bane of the neighborhood when I get it going.  When I was mowing, I certainly could hear it, but the sound was muffled as it should be.  It sounded somewhat like a lawnmower in the distance rather than one I was pushing.  There certainly wasn't going to be any ringing in my ears after this experiment.\\n\\nThe comfort level was high and the cups were very secure and held fast to my head.  The cups and headband are plastic and have an inner foam cushioning.  The cushioning is not thick, but they were not uncomfortable at all.  They were sweaty, but thats going to happen if you're mowing a lawn or moving around in any capacity.  If they were leather, Id be unable to keep them clean so plastic is easy.\\n\\nThey have a rather unique fold-up design.  Once I was through with them, I was able to put the cups together and push them back up into the assembly beneath the headband.  The earmuffs can be easily transported or put back in the box because of the small footprint.  Very nice earmuffs that certainly muffled the sound of my old clunker.\\n\\nSample provided for review.\",\n",

In this case, it\\'s\\nsimply a \"better mousetrap.\"  Flawless design and excellent manufacturing execution.  The 4 gravity drop lips can be locked up for long board work, a nice feature, but they slide inward nicely when not at the board end.  The lip locks are ideal when holding the push blocks perpendicular to the table surface, such as re-sawing.  This IMO is a long awaited feature in push blocks, hard to fathom it took this long for such an obvious and useful feature.\\n\\nThe material used, is a lightweight plastic, but appears to be VERY strong, a good choice.  The handles are extremely thick and ROBUST, easy to get a good grip on vs. many cheap push blocks whose handles are way to thin.  The handles are angled just-right.  The non slip pad has excellent traction, hopefully the pads will stand the test of time.  Possibly,  the manufacturer has designed the pads to be replaced if needed.  Should be interesting to see how long this excellent traction lasts.\\n\\nMy only suggestion would be, sell them in a 2pk as most people buy two.\\n\\nMy purchases was from WordWerks through Amazon.  A great partnership IMO.  WWerks has always been a 1st class e-tailer in my experience, always fair shipping rates, and timely shipping as well.  I am glad they have teamed with Amazon.  Hopefully WWerks will start offering more products through Amazon, and allow Amazon to do their fulfillment so they can benefit from Amazon Prime membership. Lets face it, Amazon has the internet mail order business down to a science.  Only a few ww companies have embraced this so far, such as Rockler and Woodcraft, and both on a very small scale.\\n\\nA final word.... this product is on the high end of pricing for push blocks...but push blocks are a safety item in the wood shop.  A push block slipping off the wood, slipping off the end of the board, etc, can not only reduce the quality of the milling, but it can also cause an accident.  It \"sometimes\" takes a lot of pressure to push the wood through certain milling tasks.  A product like this will last you a life time.  So, save money in other areas of ww, as all ww\\'s should think SAFETY FIRST!  And remember, the best push blocks in the world won\\'t stop your shirt sleeves from entering a rotating cutter, the most obvious being the jointer.  Make sure your sleeves are rolled up and are a safe distance away from the blade / cutter! In the ww shop, the old adage surely applies, \"an ounce of prevention is worth 50lbs of cure!\" (sorry for the safety rant)\\n\\nHighly recommended product.',\n",
