For whatever reasons, the Indigo Buntings prefer this feeder even though they're small and the Rose-Breasted Grosbeaks don't fit on the small perches of my other feeders so this is the only one they come to.  The little birds use it as well as the others.\\n\\nSquirrels, of course, can't get any food from it, although they can get the ring off sometimes.  There's nothing else for them to get a grip on although they have tried, but apparently the word went out, because they don't come around anymore.  I've got the ring on there pretty tight at this point.  There are easy directions if you have to replace it or tighten it.\\n\\nThe feeder is also guaranteed forever so if the ring gets lost for any reason, it will be replaced free.  You don't actually need the ring, as there are perches around the bottom with access to the seed openings and not using it even further deters squirrels, but my birds seem to like it.  Even though the Grosbeaks are only in my area for a short time, they are so pretty, I'm eager to provide an environment that attracts them.\\n\\nThe large tube of this feeder makes it easier to fill than other tube feeders and it's easy to hang high as it has a rigid hanger that allows you to hold it over your head to reattach on a tall pole.  It is a durable feeder and popular with the birds because they can still feed in large numbers even when the feeder is almost empty since all the feedholes are around the bottom.  A great squirrel proof feeder.  Highly recommended.\",\n",

As soon as the safflower seed was used and replaced with other types of seed the large gangs of Grackles returned within two days. In my opinion, safflower seed is pricey on Amazon but still less expensive than local stores..\\nThe seed was delivered in secured packaging and it was clean. No problems with it.',\n",

I grow alfalfa and broccoli sprouts and start a new tray about every 7 days and never run out. I just empty the bottom tray, pour water in the top tray and wait.

I use a mix of water/sugar at 3:1 ratio, a tablespoon of molasses,  cup of vinegar, and a can of cheap beer. Pour the mix up to the bottom of the first entry points, and watch all of the action. I am getting so many dead critters that I have to empty the traps nearly every day, and the pool area is generally wasp/yellow jacket clear. (P.S.

My only big complaints are that chalk markers tend to not work well because they bleed into every tiny imperfection in the wall surface but that's not likely the result of the powder or paint so much as the wall. Just something I felt worth noting to folks who plan to use this the same way we did.\\n\\nOverall, I'm really happy I picked this powder.

       " 'We have a good amount of patio furniture and a lot (18-25, currently) of Classic Accessory-branded covers. This easily fit a large, armed club-type metal patio chair, with room to spare.\\n\\nWe\\'ve found all the Classic covers to be fairly sturdy, and quite waterproof. They have both click latches AND elastic band straps to hold them in place in even fierce wind. They also feature mesh vents to prevent mildew. This Hickory version features a decorative canvas stripe that actually has some function to allow you to know if you\\'ve got the cover on correctly and evenly. They also have thicker, cushier, faux-leather handles that are nice, mostly because they\\'re easy to locate quickly when taking the cover on and off, rather than the standard, same-color canvas loop handles which tend to just blend in to the cover itself.\\n\\nOur only knock on the Classic covers we\\'ve had over the years is that, with time and outdoor use, they become brittle from the sun and rip easily. Covers used constantly in direct sunshine tend to last only a year or so, while Classic covers in more protected areas have lasted 2-3 seasons on average. (Full disclosure: We are in the Southwest where the sun is intense and summers are usually long and very dry.)\\n\\nThe Classic Atrium line at least feels more heavy-duty than the standard Ravenna (haven\\'t had the Atrium long enough yet to know if that is true), but this Hickory feels identical to the many Ravenna covers we have in thickness and material, so while I can\\'t say for sure as this is brand new now, I fear it will suffer from the same problem.\\n\\nWhile the sun damage/brittleness might sound bad, and it is definitely a bummer, Classic still makes the best patio furniture covers we\\'ve found after trying MANY other brands. They offer a reasonable price point, decent durability and excellent protection. So far, even covers we\\'ve bought that cost three times as much, and came with supposed \"lifetime guarantees,\" have had the same issue with becoming brittle. And when we asked about that lifetime guarantee for the $200 cover that lasted less than a year, they said it didn\\'t cover sun damage or tearing ... So what did it cover? They couldn\\'t tell me. On the other hand, Classic has generously and quickly honored their warranty the few times we\\'ve needed it for covers that have lasted less than six months.

Some debris from yard waste may clog release at times.\\n?  I use a foxtail broom to wipe off the outside after each use.  When first starting up after previous usage, the bag emits quite a lot of fine dust/dirt that is annoying.

       " \"If you read my review of the medium version of this kit, HK200, my sentiments are the same.\\n\\nI'm a first year beekeeper and found myself really enjoying the hobby. I currently have two hives, a mid season installed nuc that did very well, so well that part of the hive swarmed. The captured swarm became the second colony. Assuming a successful overwinter, they'll need additional space to grow. Hence the purchase of the Mann Lake HK180 (deep) super.\\n\\nThe HK180 super is constructed of pine, accommodates 10 frames, preassembled, unfinished and includes 10 medium wood frames with waxed Rite-Cell foundation. If you're worried about the bees not drawing comb on the plastic foundation, don't. I purchased these earlier in the year and the bees drew them out quickly, as alluded to during the opening paragraph.\\n\\nThe super, with all 10 frames inserted, is a little heavier than the medium but that's to be expected. Each corner of the super is connected using finger joints with staples strategically placed for added strength. The quality of the pine was acceptable, as no knots, fractures, cracks or off putting smells were observed. With that being said, I did notice inconsistent spacing between some of the finger joints. While minimal, this could allow water to enter the joints and compromise their structural integrity over time. Nevertheless, the solution was an easy one, we simply used a bit of wood filling putty, sanded it down and gave the super three coats of a white satin exterior paint. Yeah I know, three coats may be overkill but hey, my son and I shared quality bonding time and the super turned out great.\\n\\nThis super will serve dual purposes. Throughout the winter, I will remove the frames and use it to house a gallon mason jar feeder.  While in the spring, I will install the frames and add it as a brood chamber. Now, before the comments come in asking where did I find the gallon mason jar feeder, my beekeeping mentor had a couple extra that I purchased. I plan to use a new and unused epoxy lined paint can for my other hive but back to the review.\\n\\nOverall I'm pleased with the purchase. The fact that the super was readily available, preassembled, included frames and foundation and reasonably priced (I guess) made it an easier buy for this hunting, fishing, soap making, canning, photographing, too many irons in the fire beekeeper. Hopefully we'll get many years of use from it.\",\n",

This pruner works well - better at cutting thicker branches than my non-ratcheting pruners - and has very sharp blades.

I haven't watered it since it arrived, and yet the soil is still quite saturated. This gives me cause for concern since the soil should only be moist for this plant, even though it is a tropical. I am leaving it outside for the next couple days to see if that will help, rather than by the window where it has been. I snapped a photo which i will have available here for review. I will continue to update this as things change for good or for bad. Presently, i can only offer three stars on the plant.\\n\\nJuly 6th: It has recovered and is doing quite a bit better. The broken leaf has actually grown back and looks strong. In addition, a new leaf is unfurling from the top of the plant. Definitely looks a lot better now. I have upped my rating to four stars to reflect the change in status.\\n\\nAugust 20th: The plant is doing quite well. Each new leaf that unfurls is larger than the last. What i have found is that the plant doesn't like direct sunlight, but does thrive in the heat. So, placing it in the shade seems to be the way to go...at least for my plant...at least until it gets cold, then it's coming inside for the winter.\\n\\nUpdate, January 6 (2012): This is by far the healthiest and most vibrant plant i own at this point. Each new leaf grows larger than the last. I have it indoors presently for the winter, sitting next to a window. It is still thriving. Some interesting notes....the leaves tend to grow against the window (because it is the light source most likely), and they trap condensation between them and the window, which seems to be beneficial. Also, we have had an issue with gnats, but for some reason, they tend to die around the banana plant, which is really good. We clean up the little bug graveyard every so often, and this benefits out other plants. I will take some more pictures soon, but from what i can tell, if your plant survives its transplant(s), you will have a wonderful addition to your home and/or garden. Presently, the plant is about three and a half feet tall, btw.\",\n",

It\\'s a lime green which, to my eye, is a lot more attractive than the standard white. The case color also has a practical benefit in that it helps to highlight the control buttons on the receiver since they are now white on a green background and have black labeling.\\n\\nPerformance has been excellent. I have and use the ET-733 (the white version) a lot, and won\\'t grill or use my smoker without it. You can use the two probes to measure the BBQ temp and the meat temp (huge help when using a smoker. You\\'ll be amazed at how much heat is lost when you open the smoker during operation) or two different meats. The displays on both the monitor and remote units are clear and easy to read. It\\'s pretty easy to use, but you\\'ll want to read through the manual first (it\\'s short, but pretty well-written) to get familiar with all the options. Probe placement is especially critical for performance -- you want to position the probe in the thickest area of the meat or you\\'ll get erroneous results.\\n\\nWith the exception of the color I didn\\'t notice any performance difference in terms of temperature accuracy or range. The green version synced up between the remote and the base just as quickly as the older model. The build quality is also the same (generally good, with the only exception being the flip out stands which are made of rather thin wire).\\n\\nIt comes with batteries (AAA alkalines). I noticed the same issue with this version as I have with other versions in that it doesn\\'t seem to like rechargeable batteries all that much, especially in the remote unit. I get better range and quicker syncing when I use alkalines. The battery life is good (get months out of the battery using it at least a couple times per week) so it doesn\\'t chew through batteries quickly, but I would still like it better if I could use rechargeables reliably.\\n\\nThe pre-set temperature ranges is very comprehensive covering both the basics (chicken, fish, beef, veal, etc.) plus game meats such as elk and deer. It\\'s a handy feature even if you prefer to set your own temp targets.\\n\\nWhile the device is marketed towards outdoor coking, you can also use it when cooking in the oven indoors. The probe wire is thin enough that the oven door still closes just fine with the wire passing through it. Depending on how your oven door gaskets are situation you may need to be careful that the wire does not get pinched since a broken lead wire will render this inoperable.\\n\\nThis dresses up an already excellent performing remote thermometer with a nice new color. Since the performance is the same as the white version, you can cross-shop this between models to get the one that has the best price without losing any functionality.\\n[Sample provided for review]',\n",

The color had lightened up and there was a date stamp of some time in early 2012. I tried using it and it seems to have lost it's effect.

       " \"I've been using Jack's Professional aka Jack's Classic All Purpose 20-20-20 for many years.  You can water virtually all of your garden with this fertilizer!  I use it for both outdoor & indoor plants.  I've even used it to revive part of my yard that was dying!  It can also be used in both soil & soilless mediums.  If you are unsure on how much you should use 1/2 of recommended dose is a good start.  If your plants start to claw you are feeding them too much.  If they start to fade in color you can probably feed them a little more.  You can also use this as a foliage spray (use about .25 normal dose).\\n\\nIf your plants are turning yellow or fading in color this will brighten them back up again!\\n\\nIt's a shame this is not sold anywhere where I live.\\n\\nHere's a little info from J.R. Peters site that you might find useful:\\n\\nJack's All Purpose 20-20-20\\n\\nJust as the name suggests, Jack's All Purpose 20-20-20 is a balanced formula applicable to a variety of growing material. Its 1:1:1 nutrient ratio makes it good for almost any stage of plant growth. The design of the formula uses nutrients that provide strength to the plant, as well as, lush green growth. It can be used as a constant liquid feed or periodic feed, alternating with water or rain to provide the plant with a boost of balanced nutrition.\\n\\nPreferably, it should be used on soil-based media, rather than on soilless media, primarily during warmer months, indoors or in warm-climate regions. These environments allow the roots to take up the nitrogen sources most effectively. Long-term use of high Phosphorus formulas can lead to plant stretch in some plant varieties. Therefore, it is recommended when using this formula over long periods (greater than 3-4 months) of plant growth, alternate with a lower Phosphorous source such as rainwater, calcium nitrate or other lower phosphorus fertilizers.\\n\\nApplication of this fertilizer can be used as a root drench or foliar spray. The nutrient package in the All-Purpose 20-20-20 is designed for optimum absorption by the leaves when sprayed at the recommended rates; however, a root drench is just as effective and will leave little to no salt build up in the media.\\n\\nAll Purpose 20-20-20 can be used on many types of plants including, but not limited to:\\n\\nOrchids (all varieties)  both  blooming and in vegetative state Use All Purpose 20-20-20 for Apples\\nCyclamen\\nHibiscus\\nCitrus trees\\nChrysanthemums\\nAll bedding plants\\nHanging baskets\\nMixed containers\\nPetunias & Calibrachoas\\nGardenia\\nBromeliads\\nRoses\\nAll types of Berries\\nSunflower\\nTomatoes\\nAll vegetables\\nRegular and Giant Pumpkins\\nHome lawns\\nCommercial turf grass\\nHay and forage plots\\n\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nAll Purpose 20-20-20 is our biggest seller for home professional grower formulas. It is widely used in a variety of settings from bedding plants, vegetable gardens, fruit trees, nursery materials including, trees, shrubs and container plants. In addition, the All-Purpose 20-20-20 is used extensively in conjunction with spray materials for foliar feeding of ornamental and shade trees, turf and hay field applications in the same manner.

That being said, there are a few things I need to note.\\n\\nFirst, it is clearly cheaply manufactured in China, and assembling it required some minor modifications on my part. It goes together with a combination of screws and interlocking parts, but some of the parts weren't totally free of flash, so I had to file that off in places.  The biggest challenge was getting the bird bath to connect to the bottom section of pole. The bolt would not thread into it, so I had to use a longer bolt, and it wobbled on the  pole. So, I took a hot glue gun and applied glue all around the part where it meets both the top section and underneath. This also made a seal to keep water from leaking out of the bird bath, which it surely would have done.\\n\\nI put some rocks and flowers in the bottom, and that stabilized it since it is top heavy. Someone suggested garden staples or stakes, and that's a great idea.\\n\\nThe light actually works, but at first it didn't. The instructions don't mention that there's a little on/off switch in the battery compartment. Fortunately, all that was required was that I flip the switch. The light is dim, so don't expect any real illumination from it. It's more for ambience.\\n\\nThe instructions are clear, so that was no problem (except for the part about the light).\\n\\nOverall, I gave it a high rating because I absolutely love how it looks in my garden. For the price paid, I'm happy. I get lots of compliments, and it sure doesn't look like the plastic that it is.

When assembling it I thought the guard wheel had to \"attach\" tightly to something -- but it really just sets there and spins as it goes along -- keeping it from getting stuck.  Initially, it took two of us to get the flow regulator set -- one turning the pump on and off, and the other checking the reading and making adjustments as there was some distance between the two of us.  Once that was done it worked fine.  We have three steps at the shallow end of the pool and while the Baracuda doesn\\'t climb the steps, it does a good job on the rest of the pool.  It now takes me less than five minutes a week to brush the steps and a seat we have at the deep end.

I don't jerk the weed out, I leverage it out.  And when I do, I watch the joint between the metal and pole for stress.  So far, I've maybe reset the tool a couple of times to reduce stress.  Worst case, if the pole breaks, get a new one.  Make it a metal one if you want, but I don't want or need to lug a heavy tool around when the wood pole works fine.\\n\\n2) Yes, you have to touch the weeds!  I take almost all weeds out of the claws.  It's the simplicity of this tool that I like, and if there were mechanisms that would spring open the claws and push out the weed, there would be more to break.  Plus, I have to put the weed in my bucket, so I have to touch it anyway.  If my bucket was heavier, I could easily scrape the weed off the claws on the top edge of the bucket.\\n\\n3) This tool keeps me standing erect!

For application, initially I purchased a duster made for this task but it was pricey and it was awkward to operate, so now I use hair coloring style plastic bottles with the narrow nozzle.\\n\\nThese are easy to find in beauty supply stores or in the cake/cookie decorating sections of hobby or discount stores. A funnel I keep with garden supplies and use exclusively for this purpose is necessary to get the product into the bottle. I have a few filled bottles so they are ready when I spot a problem. One is in the garage and one under the sink in the kitchen and main bath.\\n\\nThe narrow nozzle helps squeeze the fine dust precisely where I want it  like outdoors in cracks in the concrete when ant activity appears, or ant hills. Inside I squeeze small amounts in areas where I see spiders or other bugs  usually around baseboards. If the bottle opening gets clogged, do not squeeze hard which may release more product than intended. Just tap the bottom on a flat surface to loosen the powder and continue.\\n\\nIt needs to be reapplied when it gets wet, but so does almost any pesticide. It is messy but a little goes a long way and squeezing a line of it at entrance/exit thresholds from outdoors to indoors is often sufficient to keep bug numbers to a minimum.\\n\\nMy veterinarian felt more comfortable with this type of product being used around dogs versus the toxic chemicals found in most insecticides/pesticides that can be tracked on their paws and absorbed through their skin in much greater concentrations than would affect the humans around them.\\n\\nNo vacuum cleaner problems, either, but I also never used it in carpeting. The product, used in small amounts around doorways, baseboards and in limited outdoor applications has kept insects to a bare minimum, stopping them before they can breed and create real issues.\\n\\nDecisions should be made from personal research done on reputable sites, and specifics discussed with doctors and veterinarians, but from my perspective the negatives are minor compared to the chemical alternatives.',\n",

The BIGGEST complaint is, if you look at the photo closely, right behind the front wheel, where it says \"EdgeMax\" the plastic is a hard right angle and not CURVED like my old mower. So, this hard piece of plastic catches on my chain link fence if I get too close. The old one had a CURVED edge on this part and allowed me to just mow along the fence touching the fence the whole time with no fuss. With this design, if you go too close, it constantly catches the fence, stops you in your tracks, give you a hernia and then you have to pull the mower away from the fence. This is what happens when the engineer doesn\\'t use the product. Again, LOOK AT THE PHOTO just behind the front wheel and you will see the hard plastic that is going to hit your fence and stop you in your tracks. Also, I used my old mower only in the \"Mulch\" function. I never had ANY twigs, rocks or dust for over 12 years that I used the unit. On \"Mulch\", this one throws twigs and TONS OF DIRT and DUST.

The snapping teeth will often cut and maim a rat without instantly killing it, and this is cruel to the rat and unpleasant for the person wishing to exterminate the rat. When this caught and killed a rat I just threw it away rather than trying to extricate the rat and clean the trap for reuse. For reusable traps I recommend the electronic ones, that will electrocute the rat when it goes in after the bait. Those electronic traps work well indoors but can't be used outdoors. With any trap it is important to bait it and place it properly, and to check it regularly. The Tomcat snap trap is fairly good at killing rats but not a clean, humane method.

These are not that expensive, but are an initial investment if your buying a lot of them...like I did. The good news is they are very sturdy and have withstood the beating that New Jersey and it's extreme summers can bring.\\n\\nA couple of hints though. Some plants/veggies like these more than others. You will have to experiment to see which ones on your list do. This was a terrible year for me in terms of garden production due to our weather and getting hit with garden virus, so it's hard to really judge with accuracy which ones did better in them or in the ground, but it seems the lettuces loved these things. I also planted small sapling trees in them that I will be putting in the ground and they loved them too.\\n\\nThey come in all sizes and the largest ones can really hold a lot of dirt. I used those for trees, herbs, potatoes and sweet potatoes.\\n\\nPros:\\nSturdy\\nLong range problem solving for small or container & apartment gardens\\nFold up nicely in the fall when I'm putting the garden to bed.\\n\\nCons:\\nMight cost you a bit if your buying a lot of them, but even then, they are cheaper than a plastic container.\",\n",

You get what you pay for I would Assume.\\nThis grow tent is attractive by design from a short distance away and as you get closer you start to notice some things such as light leaks and poor stitching to name a couple. The tent that I received has so many light leaks- all over the tent resulting from the poor stitching on the zippers, the semi-transparent zippers that wrap completely around the tent, the gaps between the zipper ends (where they join on the ends), the accessory / vent ports (single-sleeved pull tight with outside velcro cover with velcro gaps. The flap that hangs over zipper's path just hangs allowing light to enter from underneath. I constructed my tent, then stepped inside and zipped back up. When I looked down I could see my feet and read my watch. That's unacceptable for hydro gardens, light leaks will stress your plants and can cause the plants to change from male to female. Another problem with the holes in the tent is odor control. Tent is also not very user-friendly when opening and closing. Extra effort is needed when trying to align zippers center bottom when closing.\",\n",

       " \"Not joking, I cannot say enough good things about this generator!\\n\\nSo, if you are looking at this you are looking specifically to power a camper or RV. I took this out on it's maiden trip and tested it under the conditions that I intended to use it for. Outside of it being loud (although I plan to make some minor changes to reduce the noise) it performed admirably!\\n\\nFirst I prepped it for the trip, having been unused and just started for a test. I filled the tank and mounted it up for travel. It took about three gallons of fuel. Next I traveled along a dirt road with this generator not in the optimum position, and it handled it all just fine....but this isn't amazing since I didn't abuse it either. So the first night I took it easy, running only a CPAP and a small fan. It ran for just over 8 hours without a problem. The fuel tank was not empty either. During the day I ran it for three hours running the AC, TV, and everything in the camper. It barely registered the change until the AC kicked in, but it easily took the power draw. So for night two I filled the tank again, admittedly not leaving room for expansion since i would begin running it right away. This time I ran the fan in the camper, but with the AC unit turned off, along with the CPAP, plugged in fan, a few things charging, the refrigerator, and the hot water heater. So now I expected it to run out of fuel after six hours. Here is the shocker...it ran 10 and 1/2 hours! I slept, showered, dressed, cooked and ate all while this was powering the camper....with a wife and 3 kids! I admit that I was not putting a full load on it, but with all of this it ran as if it was at an idle the whole time.\\n\\nI will be changing the oil and prepping for another trip, but this was an investment I am glad I made!\",\n",

Ive read that these skids are to adjust the auger height and Ive found following that advice was causing me some problems. I have an old Craftsman 5HP 2-stage thrower (536.886540) and my drive is compacted gravel and is not perfectly even so I was heaving some stones like a trebuchet. I set the skids to keep the auger high enough that I thought I would be enough above ground to stop checking stones. I was adding some rubber extensions to my impeller because we do get a lot of snow when the ground is soft and/or it warms quickly so I was having issues with the chute jamming with slush. Its really nice not hurling rocks and/or gravel now because with the rubber extensions on the impeller I was able to thrown on about 100-feet so good thing Im in a rural area and not pointing the chute toward anything fragile. I do get the occasional stone because when the ground starts to freeze itll push some up and with some snow on the ground they cant be seen.  In watching a video I found someone with pretty much the situation I was having and he pointed to the scraper under his machine that he needed to set higher to clear the gravel. I checked mine and it was on the concrete floor in my garage so after lifting it about a quarter inch my problem was all but solved. The original skid on one side broke and bent down after I hooked a steel fence along the driveway so I needed to replace one but for about 3-bucks more I could two and replace both so they were a match you wouldnt want anyone to see you had two different colors of skids would you? I think these are all but identical to the OEM shoes I have but they're a bit better because they're reversible. I was under the impression the auger was the only way snow gets into the removal process but the scraper on the bottom is really what determines how close to the ground you're getting so I was adjusting the wrong portion of the machine. if you set the skid thats on the bottom behind the auger to the correct height the auger height takes care of itself so the shoes aren't there to set the auger height though that would be pretty much a moot point on a paved drive since you would likely want the scraper touching the surface. No complaints with these shoes and at under 11-bucks it was a good purchase. The only issues I have are with the listing because these are not limited to models that are 2007 and Newer and with all those part numbers shown in the title I received Stens 780-257 (not mentioned) and they are a perfect fit so go by the measurements and not just by whats stated in the heading. The Stens I received are exactly 2-7/8 wide x 3 high and 3/4 deep and made in Taiwan which makes them a bit smaller than stated but the slots are 2 on center and thats exactly what I needed. Not sure why some were disappointed in what they received but mine are thick, heavy and weigh about 6-ounces each and are by no means less than the OEM they replaced.\",\n",

After the first throw, I expected it to cut through the lily pad stems and other weeds, but it hung up on them, and just pulled through without cutting.  I thought perhaps it was my technique, and reread the directions, which say to pull through with a tugging motion.  Tried again several times with similar results, it pulled over the weeds, and cut only a very  few.  The blades are extremely dull when brand spanking new, I sharpened them and they do not hold on edge even after one throw.  Additionally, the directions say not to overtighten the red weed deflector as it could break, so I didn't.  It is snug  as directed.

Stick with raking leaves onto a tarp or putting them in a can than step on the leaves.\\n\\nI used the Worx (purchased from Amazon) and had to return it. Here are the problems:\\n1) Leaves must be bone dry, even the slightest moisture from the leaves themselves can causes the machine to clog up, requiring you to turn in off and unload it by hand.  This makes the whole experience take significantly longer that simply raking into a square garbage can, compacting it, and dragging it to the curb.\\n2) the shredding is accomplished through weed wacker plastic lines.  These are not only inefficient to shred volume of leaves quickly, but you have to \"aid\" the whole process by shaking the shredder to encourage them to fall out the bottom of the machine and also feed more leaves into it.\\n3) the helicopter motion of the spinning trimmer twine actually keeps the leaves in the hopper rather then expel them.  Sure, some fall out into whatever receptacle you\\'re using, but most don\\'t, ultimately clogging the whole machine and requiring manual clean out.\\n4) Even with dry leaves, any moisture defeats the device.  My leaves were dry and it had not rained for three days, but even the morning dew was enough moisture to clog the whole machine.  I spent more time unclogging the machine filled with dry leaves, than actually running it.\\n5) Twigs also defeat the machine.  Even the smallest 1mm thin twigs that you don\\'e even see or know are mixed in with the leaves interrupt the \"shredding\" ability and ultimately clog the machine.  Ugh.\\n\\nAfter about two hours of trying to get the shredder to integrate into our leaf clean up efforts, I gave up on the device and went back to tarps and buckets. It took significantly less time that when using the shredder.  Sure, the leaf pile at the end of my drive is bigger than the pile from our shredder side of the lawn, but it was significantly quicker not involving the shredder.\\n\\nI feel the product suffers from failed design.  I needs a bigger hopper, a better \"shredder\" mechanism (not based on a weed wacker), and more slats for the leaves to exit the bin once shredded.  Plus the stand needs to be bigger to fit a standard garbage can. Otherwise, it just clogs up too quickly and is easily defeated by leaves, a little morning dew, tiny twigs, and poor design.  Avoid.

       " \"I had the previous version of this leaf blower for about 15 years, but it finally died.  The new one was highly rated in the leading consumer review magazine, so I went ahead and ordered it.\\n\\nFirst impressions - it's a lot bigger than the last one, and heavier too.  Power seems to be about the same as before, which is more than adequate.  It moves even clumped wet leaves.  Noise is perhaps a tad quieter than the old one, but not enough to matter.  You still need ear protection for it.  It might not bother the neighbors quite as much, but you still aren't going to be able to run it at dawn on a Saturday morning without irritating them.\\n\\nThe old version had a clip on the back that held the extension cord.  It didn't work particularly well, but was better than nothing.  This one requires that you tie the extension cord to the handle, which is probably not the greatest for the extension cord, but at least there is a dongle wire on the back to plug into, which is an improvement.\\n\\nThey play up the idea that you can not just blow leaves with this, but also vacuum them up.  This is the same pitch they made about the last version.  In the last one, it was an extremely bad idea to use the vacuum because the impeller was made of plastic.  So using it to grind up leaves was an excellent way to destroy the impeller and ruin the blower.  I threw away the vacuum attachments on the old one - which is probably why it lasted as long as it did.\\n\\nToro has apparently acknowledged that a plastic impeller is not a good idea for vacuuming up leaves, since the new impeller is now made of metal with serrated edges.  So I decided to try it out, because I have a couple of basement window wells that are always difficult to get clean.  The new vacuum works very well for this kind of small scale, specialized area where just blowing the leaves isn't going to work well.  The bag they give you is relatively small.  Even though ground-up leaves take up a lot less room than regular leaves, you aren't going to suck up a yard full of them with this thing.  The sucking power is adequate - it will jam on you if you manage to suck up too much at once.  That means turning it off and sometimes having to reach up into the nozzle to pull the jam free.  Often just turning it off and thumping the pipe on the ground once releases the jam.  The bag was full after 3 window wells full, and the wells had maybe 6-8 inches of compressed leaves in each.\\n\\nI tried to use the unit to vacuum up around a mature bush that is always difficult to get clean with a rake, because there are lots of branches and such in the way.  It was better than the rake, but not amazingly better - the whole thing is kind of big and bulky - which makes it difficult to stick into the kind of out-of-the-way places you are often going to want to use the vacuum for.\\n\\nYou pay for the improved ability to suck up leaves in two ways:  (1) It is relatively heavy because of the big metal impeller in there; and (2) the impeller can't be cheaply made to the high tolerances required for it to be perfectly balanced -  so it introduces a little extra vibration into the unit.  You will want to wear gloves when using this whether or not the weather is cold.  I can still feel the effects in my hands an hour later.  For the couple times of year you use a leaf blower like this it is not that big a deal, but I would never use this thing frequently - it is really not a good idea to inflict that kind of vibration on your hands with any frequency.\\n\\nSo to sum up - yes you actually can use it to vacuum up leaves now.  That is an improvement over the older one, where the vacuum was essentially a self-destruct mechanism.  But to fix that problem, this is basically an inferior blower when used as a blower than the old one it replaces.\\n\\nIf I could choose between buying the older version again and buying this - I'd buy the older one and clean out the window wells by hand.  It was significantly lighter, just about as powerful, about as loud and didn't vibrate my hands aggressively.  In fact, I am probably going to take the old one apart now and see if I can fix it.  I will keep this one, but I don't really like it enough to recommend it.  I would probably buy something else unless you absolutely have to have the vacuum feature.  For its core use - this version is unequivocally inferior to the one it replaced.\\n\\n.\",\n",

If you have a larger 2 story house I think it would still be good as the image is strong but you need to have a distance twice as big as mine to do that. It also has themes for all major holidays which is nice. It has a sensor that it starts before it is dark or close. It probably should be less sensitive to low light but not a big deal. You can switch to 4 or 6 hours on. Definitely set it to 6 hours and maybe it will stay on until 11pm.

Other punches are difficult to use effectively on older, softened hose, and often with those I have to use a small pen knife after punching to complete the punch. This one works on old and new hose. Only criticism is that it should be a brighter color (red, yellow, or orange) because it is easy to lose in dark soil--it is so small.
